Skip to main contentSkip to footerResearchEconomic FuturesCommitmentsLearnNewsTry ClaudeAnnouncementsDonating the Model Context Protocol and establishing the Agentic AI FoundationDec 9, 2025Today, we’re donating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), a directed fund under the Linux Foundation, co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, and Bloomberg.Model Context ProtocolOne year ago, we introduced MCP as a universal, open standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Since then, MCP has achieved incredible adoption:Across the ecosystem: There are now more than 10,000 active public MCP servers, covering everything from developer tools to Fortune 500 deployments;Across platforms: MCP has been adopted by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Visual Studio Code, and other popular AI products;Across infrastructure: Enterprise-grade infrastructure now exists with deployment support for MCP from providers including AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.We’re continuing to invest in MCP’s growth. Claude now has a directory with over 75 connectors (powered by MCP), and we recently launched Tool Search and Programmatic Tool Calling capabilities in our API to help optimize production-scale MCP deployments, handling thousands of tools efficiently and reducing latency in complex agent workflows.MCP now has an official, community-driven Registry for discovering available MCP servers, and the November 25th spec release introduced many new features, including asynchronous operations, statelessness, server identity, and official extensions. There are also official SDKs (Software Development Kits) for MCP in all major programming languages with 97M+ monthly SDK downloads across Python and TypeScript. Since its inception, we’ve been committed to ensuring MCP remains open-source, community-driven and vendor-neutral. Today, we further that commitment by donating MCP to the Linux Foundation.The Linux Foundation and the Agentic AI FoundationThe Linux Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the growth of sustainable, open-source ecosystems through neutral stewardship, community building, and shared infrastructure. It has decades of experience stewarding the most critical and globally-significant open-source projects, including The Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, Node.js, and PyTorch. Importantly, the Linux Foundation has a proven track record in facilitating open collaboration and maintaining vendor neutrality.The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) is a directed fund under the Linux Foundation co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare and Bloomberg. The AAIF aims to ensure agentic AI evolves transparently, collaboratively, and in the public interest through strategic investment, community building, and shared development of open standards.Donating the Model Context ProtocolAnthropic is donating the Model Context Protocol to the Linux Foundation&#x27;s new Agentic AI Foundation, where it will join goose by Block and AGENTS.md by OpenAI as founding projects. Bringing these and future projects under the AAIF will foster innovation across the agentic AI ecosystem and ensure these foundational technologies remain neutral, open, and community-driven. The Model Context Protocol’s governance model will remain unchanged: the project’s maintainers will continue to prioritize community input and transparent decision-making.The future of MCPOpen-source software is essential for building a secure and innovative ecosystem for agentic AI. Today’s donation to the Linux Foundation demonstrates our commitment to ensuring MCP remains a neutral, open standard.

Block, Anthropic, OpenAI, and other leaders in AI are launching the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) to ensure agentic AI develops as an open, collaborative ecosystem. Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can take initiative, make decisions, and act independently to achieve goals with minimal human direction.\n\nThe AAIF is a vendor-neutral home for open source agentic AI projects where no single company dominates, providing funding for critical community programs and research, and building open protocols that let systems from different builders work together seamlessly. Block is contributing its open source agent goose to the AAIF, along with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and OpenAI’s AGENTS.md.\n\nIn addition to the three founding members, the AAIF’s platinum members include Amazon Web Services, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, and Microsoft.

These systems are fundamentally reshaping how developers build software, how businesses operate, and how people solve complex problems. Use of autonomous agents promises to accelerate this even further.\n\nBut we're at a critical juncture. We have an unprecedented opportunity to shape how this technology develops. Will we build open, interoperable infrastructure that serves everyone? Or will we see fragmentation that limits this powerful technology's potential? Without collaborative open development, we risk missing the full potential of agentic AI where everyone benefits thanks to open standards, open protocols, and open systems on which other tools are built. We also risk concentrating the power in the hands of a few, which dampers competition and restricts accessibility. In a proprietary, siloed ecosystem, breakthrough ideas can't easily build on each other, integration challenges slow enterprise adoption and limit use cases, accessibility barriers prevent smaller organizations from benefiting, and research limitations slow academic and independent innovation.\n\nHistory proves there’s a better path. The Internet, Linux, and the Web succeeded precisely because they were open. They empowered anyone with talent and determination to build, innovate, and create value on top of open infrastructure. Agentic AI deserves the same opportunity. We hope that the AAIF can become what the W3C is for the Web: a set of standards and protocols that guarantee interoperability, open access, and freedom of choice with open source reference implementations.\n\n\n\nWhat AAIF Will Do\n\nThe Agentic AI Foundation provides a neut...

Agent: Title: Self-Supervised Multimodal NeRF for Autonomous Driving

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework, referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs, our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domain. Code of the model is available at https://github.com/gaurav00700/Selfsupervised-NVSF

Agent: Title: A Concurrency Control Method Based on Commitment Ordering in Mobile Databases

Abstract: Disconnection of mobile clients from server, in an unclear time and for an unknown duration, due to mobility of mobile clients, is the most important challenges for concurrency control in mobile database with client-server model. Applying pessimistic common classic methods of concurrency control (like 2pl) in mobile database leads to long duration blocking and increasing waiting time of transactions. Because of high rate of aborting transactions, optimistic methods aren`t appropriate in mobile database. In this article, OPCOT concurrency control algorithm is introduced based on optimistic concurrency control method. Reducing communications between mobile client and server, decreasing blocking rate and deadlock of transactions, and increasing concurrency degree are the most important motivation of using optimistic method as the basis method of OPCOT algorithm. To reduce abortion rate of transactions, in execution time of transactions` operators a timestamp is assigned to them. In other to checking commitment ordering property of scheduler, the assigned timestamp is used in server on time of commitment. In this article, serializability of OPCOT algorithm scheduler has been proved by using serializability graph. Results of evaluating simulation show that OPCOT algorithm decreases abortion rate and waiting time of transactions in compare to 2pl and optimistic algorithms.
Agent: Title: Variant interpretation using population databases: lessons from gnomAD

Abstract: Reference population databases are an essential tool in variant and gene interpretation. Their use guides the identification of pathogenic variants amidst the sea of benign variation present in every human genome, and supports the discovery of new disease-gene relationships. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is currently the largest and most widely used publicly available collection of population variation from harmonized sequencing data. The data is available through the online gnomAD browser (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) that enables rapid and intuitive variant analysis. This review provides guidance on the content of the gnomAD browser, and its usage for variant and gene interpretation. We introduce key features including allele frequency, per-base expression levels, constraint scores, and variant co-occurrence, alongside guidance on how to use these in analysis, with a focus on the interpretation of candidate variants and novel genes in rare disease.
Agent: Title: Strong selective sweeps associated with ampliconic regions in great ape X chromosomes

Abstract: The unique inheritance pattern of X chromosomes makes them preferential targets of adaptive evolution. We here investigate natural selection on the X chromosome in all species of great apes. We find that diversity is more strongly reduced around genes on the X compared with autosomes, and that a higher proportion of substitutions results from positive selection. Strikingly, the X exhibits several megabase long regions where diversity is reduced more than five fold. These regions overlap significantly among species, and have a higher singleton proportion, population differentiation, and nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio. We rule out background selection and soft selective sweeps as explanations for these observations, and conclude that several strong selective sweeps have occurred independently in similar regions in several species. Since these regions are strongly associated with ampliconic sequences we propose that intra-genomic conflict between the X and the Y chromosomes is a major driver of X chromosome evolution.
Agent: Title: A new Watermarking Technique for Secure Database

Abstract: Digital multimedia watermarking technology was suggested in the last decade to embed copyright information in digital objects such images, audio and video. However, the increasing use of relational database systems in many real-life applications created an ever increasing need for watermarking database systems. As a result, watermarking relational database systems is now merging as a research area that deals with the legal issue of copyright protection of database systems. Approach: In this study, we proposed an efficient database watermarking algorithm based on inserting binary image watermarks in non-numeric mutli-word attributes of selected database tuples. Results: The algorithm is robust as it resists attempts to remove or degrade the embedded watermark and it is blind as it does not require the original database in order to extract the embedded watermark. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrated blindness and the robustness of the algorithm against common database attacks.
