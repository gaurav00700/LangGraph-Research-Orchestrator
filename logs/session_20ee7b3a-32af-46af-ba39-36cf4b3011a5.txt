- **SELECTED: Online introductory lectures on quantum computing from 6 November - [Link](https://home.cern/news/announcement/computing/online-introductory-lectures-quantum-computing-6-november)**: The lectures offer a structured learning path for beginners, making quantum computing accessible to a broader audience.

- **SELECTED: Quantum Country - [Link](https://quantum.country/)**: This platform is valuable for its interactive approach to learning quantum computing, catering to various levels of understanding.

### JUSTIFICATION
The selected resources provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding quantum computing. Amazon Braket offers practical tools for experimentation, while the CERN lectures provide structured learning opportunities. Quantum Country enhances the learning experience with interactive content, making it suitable for both novices and those looking to deepen their knowledge.

### SUMMARY/SYNTHESIS
Quantum computing is a revolutionary field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. It utilizes quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for complex calculations at unprecedented speeds. 

To get started in quantum computing, resources like Amazon Braket provide a practical environment for developing and testing quantum algorithms. Additionally, CERN's online lectures offer a structured introduction to the subject, making it accessible to those without prior knowledge. Quantum Country complements this learning with interactive content, reinforcing key concepts and principles. Together, these resources create a robust framework for anyone interested in exploring the potential of quantum technologies.
