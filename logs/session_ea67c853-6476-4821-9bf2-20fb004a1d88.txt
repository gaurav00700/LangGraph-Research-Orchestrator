Since then, MCP has achieved incredible adoption:Across the ecosystem: There are now more than 10,000 active public MCP servers, covering everything from developer tools to Fortune 500 deployments;Across platforms: MCP has been adopted by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Visual Studio Code, and other popular AI products;Across infrastructure: Enterprise-grade infrastructure now exists with deployment support for MCP from providers including AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.We’re continuing to invest in MCP’s growth. Claude now has a directory with over 75 connectors (powered by MCP), and we recently launched Tool Search and Programmatic Tool Calling capabilities in our API to help optimize production-scale MCP deployments, handling thousands of tools efficiently and reducing latency in complex agent workflows.MCP now has an official, community-driven Registry for discovering available MCP servers, and the November 25th spec release introduced many new features, including asynchronous operations, statelessness, server identity, and official extensions. There are also official SDKs (Software Development Kits) for MCP in all major programming languages with 97M+ monthly SDK downloads across Python and TypeScript. Since its inception, we’ve been committed to ensuring MCP remains open-source, community-driven and vendor-neutral. Today, we further that commitment by donating MCP to the Linux Foundation.The Linux Foundation and the Agentic AI FoundationThe Linux Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the growth of sustainable, open-source ecosystems through neutral stewardship, community building, and shared infrastructure. It has decades of experience stewarding the most critical and globally-significant open-source projects, including The Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, Node.js, and PyTorch. Importantly, the Linux Foundation has a proven track record in facilitating open collaboration and maintaining vendor neutrality.The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) is a directed fund under the Linux Foundation co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare and Bloomberg. The AAIF aims to ensure agentic AI evolves transparently, collaboratively, and in the public interest through strategic investment, community building, and shared development of open standards.Donating the Model Context ProtocolAnthropic is donating the Model Context Protocol to the Linux Foundation's new Agentic AI Foundation, where it will join goose by Block and AGENTS.md by OpenAI as founding projects. Bringing these and future projects under the AAIF will foster innovation across the agentic AI ecosystem and ensure these foundational technologies remain neutral, open, and community-driven. The Model Context Protocol’s governance model will remain unchanged: the project’s maintainers will continue to prioritize community input and transparent decision-making.The future of MCPOpen-source software is essential for building a secure and innovative ecosystem for agentic AI. Today’s donation to the Linux Foundation demonstrates our commitment to ensuring MCP remains a neutral, open standard. We’re excited to continue contributing to MCP and other agentic AI projects through the AAIF.Learn more about MCP at modelcontextprotocol.io and get involved with the AAIF here.Related contentSharing our compli...

   CONTENT:
   Block, Anthropic, and OpenAI Launch the Agentic AI Foundation. An initiative to advance open source agentic AI under the Linux Foundation umbrella. Today, the industry is making a pivotal choice. Block, Anthropic, OpenAI, and other leaders in AI are launching the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) to ensure agentic AI develops as an open, collaborative ecosystem. Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can take initiative, make decisions, and act independently to achieve goals with minimal human direction. The AAIF is a vendor-neutral home for open source agentic AI projects where no single company dominates, providing funding for critical community programs and research, and building open protocols that let systems from different builders work together seamlessly. Block is contributing its open source agent goose to the AAIF, along with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and OpenAI’s AGENTS.md. In addition to the three founding members, the AAIF’s platinum members include Amazon Web Services, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, and Microsoft. Gold members of the AAIF include Adyen, Arcade.dev, Cisco, Datadog, Docker, Ericsson, IBM, JetBrains, Okta, Oracle, Runlayer, Salesforce, SAP, Shopify, Snowflake, Temporal, Tetrate, and Twilio Inc. Silver members of the AAIF include Apify, Chronosphere, Cosmonic, Elasticsearch, Eve Security, Hugging Face, Kubermatic, KYXStart, LanceDB, Mirantis, NinjaTech AI, Obot.ai, Prefect.io, Pydantic, Shinkai.com, Solo.io, Spectro Cloud, Stacklok, SUSE, Uber, WorkOS, Zapier and ZED. Why This Matters Now AI systems represent one of the most significant technological shifts in decades. These systems are fundamentally reshaping how developers build software, how businesses operate, and how people solve complex problems. Use of autonomous agents promises to accelerate this even further. But we're at a critical juncture. We have an unprecedented opportunity to shape how this technology develops. Will we build open, interoperable infrastructure that serves everyone? Or will we see fragmentation that limits this powerful technology's potential? Without collaborative open development, we risk missing the full potential of agentic AI where everyone benefits thanks to open standards, open protocols, and open systems on which other tools are built. We also risk concentrating the power in the hands of a few, which dampers competition and restricts accessibility. In a proprietary, siloed ecosystem, breakthrough ideas can't easily build on each other, integration challenges slow enterprise adoption and limit use cases, accessibility barriers prevent smaller organizations from benefiting, and research limitations slow academic and independent innovation. History proves there’s a better path. The Internet, Linux, and the Web succeeded precisely because they were open. They empowered anyone with talent and determination to build, innovate, and create value on top of open infrastructure. Agentic AI deserves the same opportunity. We hope that the AAIF can become what the W3C is for the Web: a set of standards and protocols that guarantee interoperability, open access, and freedom of choice with open source reference implementations.
